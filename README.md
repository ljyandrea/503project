503 project

Drug abuse is a precarious behavior that can lead to poor health for individuals and potentially cause social 
disorder[1]. Therefore, it is critical to model an individual’s potential drug misuse risk and find solutions
to eliminate detrimental attempts. Multiple factors – societal, demographic, and psychological, etc. – are
believed to shed lights on drug use behaviors. Apart from commonly used factors (i.e. age, gender and
education), personality traits have been proposed to impact on drug abuse rate. In this project, the Five
Factor Model (FFM) is adopted to explain personality traits. FFM is generally considered as a comprehensive
taxonomy for personality traits in terms of five dimensions: Neuroticism(N), Extraversion(E), Openness to
Experience(O), Agreeableness(A), and Conscientiousness(C).
The primary goal of this study is to evaluate an individual’s risk of drug misuse based on personality
characteristics (FFM along with another two important factors: impulsiveness and sensation seeking), and
general demographic information.
